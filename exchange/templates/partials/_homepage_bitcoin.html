                <strong>History:</strong>
                Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to control its creation and management, rather than relying on central authorities.
                The history of bitcoin started with the invention and was implemented by the presumed pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who integrated many existing ideas from the cypherpunk community.
                Over the course of bitcoin's history, it has undergone rapid growth to become a significant currency both on- and offline. From the mid-2010s, some businesses began accepting bitcoin in addition to traditional currencies.
